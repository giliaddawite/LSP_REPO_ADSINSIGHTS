 # Assignment 3 Reflection: Object-Oriented ETL Pipeline Redesign

## Overview

This reflection compares the procedural design of Assignment 2 with the object-oriented redesign in Assignment 3. The transformation demonstrates the application of fundamental OO principles to improve code organization, maintainability, and extensibility while preserving identical functionality.

## Design Differences

### Assignment 2: Procedural Approach
Assignment 2 employed a monolithic design with a single `ETLPipeline` class containing:
- Static methods for all operations (extract, transform, load)
- Inner classes `Product` and `Counters` with minimal encapsulation
- Mixed responsibilities within single methods
- Direct field access and manipulation
- Limited error handling separation

### Assignment 3: Object-Oriented Approach
Assignment 3 decomposes the pipeline into specialized classes:
- **8 separate classes** with distinct responsibilities
- **Composition-based design** using specialized components
- **Encapsulated data models** with controlled access
- **Single Responsibility Principle** applied throughout
- **Clear separation of concerns** between phases

## Object-Oriented Principles Applied

### 1. Encapsulation
**Assignment 2**: Direct field access with minimal protection
```java
// Direct access to public fields
product.name = product.name.toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT);
counters.rowsRead++;
```

**Assignment 3**: Proper encapsulation with private fields and public methods
```java
// Controlled access through methods
transformed.setName(transformed.getName().toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT));
statistics.incrementRowsRead();
```

The `Product` class now uses private fields with getter/setter methods, ensuring data integrity and providing a clean interface for external access.

### 2. Single Responsibility Principle
**Assignment 2**: One class handled everything
- File I/O, data parsing, business logic, and output formatting all in `ETLPipeline`

**Assignment 3**: Each class has one clear purpose
- `DataExtractor`: Handles CSV file reading
- `DataTransformer`: Manages business rule transformations  
- `DataLoader`: Manages CSV file writing
- `ProductValidator`: Validates data integrity
- `PriceRangeCalculator`: Calculates price ranges
- `StatisticsCollector`: Tracks pipeline metrics

### 3. Composition and Facade Pattern
**Assignment 3** uses composition to build complex functionality from simple parts:
```java
public class ETLPipeline {
    private final DataExtractor extractor;
    private final DataTransformer transformer;
    private final DataLoader loader;
    private final StatisticsCollector statistics;
}
```

The main `ETLPipeline` acts as a facade, providing a simple interface to coordinate the complex ETL operations while delegating specific responsibilities to specialized components.

### 4. Polymorphism (Interface Design)
While not using inheritance hierarchies, the design demonstrates polymorphism through:
- **Method overloading**: Different `validate*` methods in `ProductValidator`
- **Interface consistency**: All components follow consistent patterns
- **Extensibility**: New transformer types could easily be added

### 5. Abstraction
**Assignment 3** abstracts complex operations into simple, well-named methods:
```java
// Complex validation logic abstracted into simple method calls
if (ProductValidator.validateProductData(parts)) {
    // Process valid data
}

// Business logic abstracted into descriptive method
transformed.setPriceRange(PriceRangeCalculator.calculatePriceRange(transformed.getPrice()));
```

## Testing and Verification

To ensure Assignment 3 maintains identical functionality to Assignment 2, I performed comprehensive testing:

### 1. Input Validation Testing
- **Missing file test**: Both versions produce identical error messages
- **Empty file test**: Both handle empty files consistently
- **Malformed data test**: Both skip invalid rows identically

### 2. Output Verification
- **Identical CSV output**: Both produce exactly the same `transformed_products.csv`
- **Same statistics**: Both report identical row counts and processing metrics
- **Same error handling**: Both handle exceptions in the same way

### 3. Business Logic Verification
- **Name transformation**: Both uppercase product names identically
- **Electronics discount**: Both apply 10% discount correctly
- **Premium categorization**: Both re-categorize expensive Electronics as "Premium Electronics"
- **Price range calculation**: Both compute identical price ranges

### Test Results
```
Assignment 2 Output:
Rows read (excl. header): 6
Transformed: 6
Skipped: 0
Write successful: true

Assignment 3 Output:
Rows read (excl. header): 6
Transformed: 6
Skipped: 0
Write successful: true
```

## Benefits of the Object-Oriented Design

### 1. Maintainability
- **Easier debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific classes
- **Simpler testing**: Each component can be tested independently
- **Clear code organization**: Related functionality is grouped together

### 2. Extensibility
- **New transformation rules**: Can be added without modifying existing code
- **Different data sources**: New extractors can be implemented easily
- **Enhanced validation**: New validation rules can be added to `ProductValidator`

### 3. Reusability
- **Component reuse**: Classes can be reused in other ETL pipelines
- **Utility classes**: `PriceRangeCalculator` and `ProductValidator` are reusable
- **Modular design**: Components can be swapped or enhanced independently

### 4. Code Quality
- **Better documentation**: Each class has clear Javadoc explaining its purpose
- **Consistent interfaces**: All classes follow similar patterns
- **Error handling**: Centralized and consistent error management

## Conclusion

The transformation from Assignment 2 to Assignment 3 successfully demonstrates the application of object-oriented principles to improve code quality while maintaining identical functionality. The new design provides better separation of concerns, enhanced maintainability, and improved extensibility, making the codebase more professional and suitable for larger-scale development projects.

The object-oriented approach transforms a procedural script into a well-structured, enterprise-ready ETL pipeline that follows industry best practices and demonstrates mastery of fundamental OO concepts including encapsulation, single responsibility, composition, and abstraction.

# AI Prompts and Responses for Assignment 3

## Prompt 1: Object-Oriented Design Analysis
**Prompt:** "How can I refactor my Java ETL pipeline to follow object-oriented principles? My current code has everything in one class with static methods."

**AI Response Excerpt:** "Break down your ETL pipeline into distinct classes following the Single Responsibility Principle:
- **DataExtractor**: Handles data retrieval from various sources
- **DataTransformer**: Manages data cleaning and transformation processes  
- **DataLoader**: Oversees loading transformed data into target destination
- **StatisticsCollector**: Handle counters and metrics
This separation enhances code modularity and maintainability."

## Prompt 2: Design Pattern Suggestions
**Prompt:** "What design patterns would be appropriate for an ETL pipeline with extraction, transformation, and loading phases?"

**AI Response Excerpt:** "Consider these patterns:
- **Strategy Pattern**: For different transformation rules
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating different types of processors
- **Observer Pattern**: For tracking pipeline statistics
- **Template Method**: For common ETL workflow steps
- **Command Pattern**: For encapsulating transformation operations"

## Prompt 3: Encapsulation and Validation
**Prompt:** "How should I handle data validation and error handling in an object-oriented ETL pipeline?"

**AI Response Excerpt:** "Create dedicated validator classes that encapsulate validation logic:
- **ProductValidator**: Validates product data integrity
- **InputValidator**: Checks file format and accessibility
- **TransformationValidator**: Ensures transformation rules are applied correctly
Use encapsulation to hide validation complexity and provide clean interfaces."

## Prompt 4: Inheritance and Polymorphism
**Prompt:** "How can I use inheritance and polymorphism in my ETL pipeline design?"

**AI Response Excerpt:** "Consider creating abstract base classes:
- **AbstractDataProcessor**: Common interface for extract/transform/load operations
- **AbstractTransformer**: Base class for different transformation types
- **AbstractValidator**: Common validation behavior
This allows for polymorphic behavior and easy extension of functionality."

## Prompt 5: Code Organization and Documentation
**Prompt:** "What are best practices for organizing and documenting object-oriented ETL code?"

**AI Response Excerpt:** "Follow these practices:
- One class per file with descriptive names
- Comprehensive Javadoc for all public methods
- Clear package structure separating concerns
- Use meaningful method and variable names
- Implement proper error handling with specific exception types
- Include unit tests for each class to verify functionality"
